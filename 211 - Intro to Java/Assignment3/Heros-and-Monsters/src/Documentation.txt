Got everything working, as far as I can tell.

I did both of the extra credit pieces.
1. Added "ForgetfulIdiot" class, available by not selecting any of the options given at the character selection screen
2. Added a special ability to each monster

Don't think I copied anything from anywhere (maybe the randInt and randDouble method).

I did model most of the messages to the user after the ones in the example program.
