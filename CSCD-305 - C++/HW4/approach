When loadCityInformation is called the file is opened into an ifstream
getline grabs the next line of the file, which is subsequently turned
into an istringstream. The first char is loaded into a controlCharacter variable
which decides how to interpret the following 3 numbers

If the character is p, the next three values will be interpreted as xyz coords
and pushed into the cityCoordinates vector as a new Point3D. The current city index
is also added to the vector of city indexes

If the character is c will be interpreted as city index and will be used to
generate city connectivity, by adding every combination of the 3 ints to the
cityConnectivity map<int, vector>

The implementation of the other functions is trivial,
and are left as an exercise for the reader ;)
