My approach was to overload all the assignment operators specified with the behavior specified, and then also override
any other operators I could think of that I thought my be useful. The assignment only specified overloads for ColorBlob,
and while implementing those, it became apparent that overloading the operators in Color would simplify code logic.
Not sure what else to say about my approach. I used nested for loops a lot, which is kind of a given because we're
dealing with a 2D array. I used the built in min and max functions to apply the upper and lower bounds.
