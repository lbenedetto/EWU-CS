My approach to getting input is to print an input prompt
then get a line of input and put it in a string stream, then
try to put the string stream into a float/int
if it fails, retry. If it succeeds, make sure the next char is a new line,
then check if it is in range.
If it is in range, return. Else, retry.

My program first gets the number of students and then uses that
number in a for loop to prompt for the grades of n students
Grades are stored in an array
When its done, calculate the required values and print.
